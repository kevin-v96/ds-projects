# DS-projects

Most of these projects follow a certain package template - I initiated them with Poetry, so you can download the individual projects and use `poetry install` (after having installed poetry on your system) inside any specific project to install the packages required by that project. The projects themselves also have READMEs that explain what they are about as well as their results. The data I used is also present in the project directories. 

This is simply my way of tracking projects that I do during my job hunt, to be able to conveniently show off different skills needed by a data scientist.
